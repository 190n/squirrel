Untitled Squirrel Game
======================

You can play [the live version](https://190n.github.io/squirrel), or run it
locally. It may not work when loaded from the filesystem (file:///) due to
browsers' security restrictions. If that is the case, run a local file server in
the directory with the game files and connect to it.

Basic Info
----------

Shoot your opponent to knock them out of the safe area and score a point. Fuel
and ammo are limited. Fuel refills when you are on the ground. Ammo can be
reloaded manually, but will reload automatically when it runs out.
